# Knight Travails

This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) to find the shortest path for a knight on a chess board from a start coordinate to an end coordinate. This project is part of the Comptuer Science section of the JavaScript course, focusing on data structures and algorithms.

To find the shortest possible path, all the possible next moves from the starting position are treated as child nodes in a "tree" (or graph). These nodes (each of which has a connection to its parent) are added to a queue and traversed via a breadth-first search approach. When the end coordinate is reached in the queue, the path from the start to the end coordinates is created by traversing the parent nodes backward starting at the end. The final path is then output to the console.
